Gauri Vilasam was not so bad or not so good, but the malayalam teacher there was 
very nice and I very much liked learning malayalam. Only problem I faced there is 
regarding mathematics. I was very poor in basic mathematics, I don't know anything 
other than +,-,x,/. No polynomial, no compound and simple interest, nothing.
I still remember, once I got 5 marks out of 50 in maths, which I remembered very clearly
lately after my plus two exam, In my Plus two exam I got 80 out of 100 in maths. I wonder
 what made me like maths  so much after 10th. May be ashokan sir and reena madam who helped 
 me alot during my high school, about which I will explain in the latter chapters.
