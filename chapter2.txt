After quiting the DISGHSS, I quit from that school because, it was mandatory to study and pass Arabic in that school, I performed poor, as teachers were not interested in teaching the subject. 
Most of the students were muslim student, and they already know Arabic from madrasa, so for it is not a good idea to teach Arabic for 3 or 4 Hindu students, so they were so lazy to teach us.
Then I have joined Govt Teachers Training Institute, from 4th standard upto standard 6, there I have enjoyed a lot. Good friends, more play time, fresh air, more freedom, good playing area. It was the only place were I engaged in sports activities like playing cricket mainly and football, I was average in cricket but poor in football.
More freedom comes with a price, It costs me dear, which I came to understand in the 7th std when I changed school to Gauri Vilasam, it was quite unfortunate for me that I never got a chance to finish my LP or UP in a single school, last year I spent in a different school.

After I finished lunch I went to college and eat my breakfast and then started dancing.
