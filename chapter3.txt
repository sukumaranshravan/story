Training school is actually like an experimental area, where teaching trainees will come and take classes along with main teachers, we were the guinea pigs. The worst subject in that school was Mathematics. Venugopal sir was the teacher who is not at all interested in teaching, he is doing some other activities which I don't remember clearly, I think he was a drama artist. Except from Theressa teacher's basic english, nothing was well taught there. So I shited to Gauri vilasam.
